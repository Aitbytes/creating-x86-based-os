Kernel Space:

Identity mapped from 0x00000000 to 0x00400000 (4MB)
This covers all the sections shown in your Section Headers
All tasks see this same mapping in their address space


Shared Memory:

Physical: 0x00500000 - 0x00500fff (4KB)
Task 1 Virtual: 0x500000 - 0x500fff
Task 2 Virtual: 0x600000 - 0x600fff
Different virtual addresses prevent mistakes in pointer handling


Task Stacks:

Each task has two 4KB stacks (user and kernel)
User stacks identity mapped:
    Process1: 0x3fffff (grows down)
    Process2: 0x4fffff (grows down)
Kernel stacks at virtual 0xC0000000
Physical locations are consecutive but separated to avoid overlap
0x200000 - 0x200fff
0x201000 - 0x201fff


Task Code:

Virtual: 0x08048000 (standard ELF loading address)
Physical: Separate 4KB pages for each task
This allows for different code in each task while using the same virtual address
