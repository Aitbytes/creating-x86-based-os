Kernel Space:

Identity mapped from 0x00000000 to 0x00400000 (4MB)
This covers all the sections shown in your Section Headers
All tasks see this same mapping in their address space


Shared Memory:

Physical: 0x00400000 - 0x00401000 (4KB)
Task 1 Virtual: 0x40000000 - 0x40001000
Task 2 Virtual: 0x50000000 - 0x50001000
Different virtual addresses prevent mistakes in pointer handling


Task Stacks:

Each task has two 4KB stacks (user and kernel)
User stacks at virtual 0x7FFFF000 (standard userland stack location)
Kernel stacks at virtual 0x80000000 (start of kernel space)
Physical locations are consecutive but separated to avoid overlap
0x402000 - 0x404000
0x403000 - 0x405000


Task Code:

Virtual: 0x08048000 (standard ELF loading address)
Physical: Separate 4KB pages for each task
This allows for different code in each task while using the same virtual address
